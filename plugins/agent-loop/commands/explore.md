# /explore - Exploration Stage

## Your Mission

Understand the problem space, codebase, and requirements thoroughly before making any decisions or plans.

## What You Should Do

1. **Read the Context**
   - Review relevant code files
   - Understand existing architecture and patterns
   - Examine related tests and specifications
   - Check documentation and comments

2. **Map the Territory**
   - Identify affected components and files
   - Understand dependencies and integration points
   - Note existing patterns to follow
   - Document current behavior

3. **Clarify Requirements**
   - Ask questions about unclear requirements
   - Verify assumptions about expected behavior
   - Understand edge cases and constraints
   - Confirm scope and acceptance criteria

4. **Research Unknowns**
   - Look up unfamiliar technologies or patterns
   - Review best practices for the task
   - Consider similar implementations in the codebase
   - Understand error handling patterns

## What You Should NOT Do

- DO NOT make assumptions when you could ask questions
- DO NOT start planning solutions yet
- DO NOT write any code
- DO NOT skip reading existing related code

## Exit Criteria

Before moving to `/plan`, ensure you can answer:
- What is the current state of the system?
- What exactly needs to change and why?
- What components will be affected?
- Are there any ambiguities or unknowns?

## When Ready

Type `/plan` to transition to the Planning stage once you have sufficient context.

**Remember**: The fastest way to finish is to understand first. Take your time in this stage - it pays off in all subsequent stages.
