# /code - Implementation Stage

## Your Mission

Implement the planned solution with discipline, quality, and attention to detail.

## What You Should Do

1. **Follow the Plan**
   - Implement in the order defined during planning
   - Start with dependencies, work up to high-level components
   - Check off items as you complete them
   - Document reasons if you deviate from plan

2. **Write Quality Code**
   - Use clear, descriptive names for functions and variables
   - Keep functions small and focused (low cyclomatic complexity)
   - Follow existing code style and patterns
   - Add inline comments for non-obvious logic
   - Write self-documenting code

3. **Implement Thoroughly**
   - Add comprehensive error handling
   - Handle edge cases identified during planning
   - Validate inputs and provide helpful error messages
   - No incomplete task markers - finish what you start
   - No hardcoded values or magic numbers

4. **Test Continuously**
   - Run tests after each significant change
   - Verify functionality works as intended
   - Check for unintended side effects
   - Ensure each commit represents working progress

5. **Maintain Quality Standards**
   - Code should be production-ready
   - No shortcuts or workarounds
   - No commented-out code
   - Extract reusable functions instead of copy-paste

## What You Should NOT Do

- DO NOT deviate from plan without explicit reason
- DO NOT write stub implementations or placeholders
- DO NOT commit broken or incomplete code
- DO NOT skip testing as you go
- DO NOT ignore errors or edge cases

## Quality Checklist

For each component implemented, verify:
- [ ] Follows planned design
- [ ] Handles errors gracefully
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No hardcoded test-specific values
- [ ] Clear and maintainable
- [ ] Consistent with existing codebase
- [ ] Edge cases handled

## Validation

After each significant change:
1. Run relevant tests
2. Verify expected behavior
3. Check for regressions
4. Ensure code quality standards met

## When You Hit Issues

If you encounter problems during implementation:
- **Small Issue**: Fix and document in commit message
- **Design Issue**: Consider if plan needs adjustment, document reasoning
- **Blocker**: Stop and ask for guidance rather than working around

## When Ready

Type `/commit` to finalize and commit your work once:
- All planned functionality is implemented
- All tests pass
- Code is reviewed and polished
- No incomplete tasks or temporary code remains

**Remember**: Quality is not negotiable. Write code you'll be proud of when reviewing it months later.
