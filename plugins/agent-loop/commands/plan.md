# /plan - Planning Stage

## Your Mission

Design the solution architecture and implementation strategy before writing any code.

## What You Should Do

1. **Design the Architecture**
   - Outline the technical approach
   - Design component interactions
   - Plan data flow and state management
   - Consider integration points

2. **Create Implementation Strategy**
   - List all files that need modification
   - Identify new files/components to create
   - Order tasks by dependencies (bottom-up)
   - Break complex changes into incremental steps

3. **Consider Quality Aspects**
   - Design for testability (clear interfaces)
   - Plan error handling strategy
   - Consider edge cases and failure modes
   - Ensure backward compatibility

4. **Document Decisions**
   - Explain key architectural choices
   - Document tradeoffs considered
   - Note alternatives and why they were rejected
   - Create step-by-step implementation checklist

5. **Use Thinking Modes**
   - Enable **extended thinking** for complex architecture decisions
   - Use **deep research** when evaluating technical approaches
   - Take time to think through alternatives

## What You Should NOT Do

- DO NOT write production code during planning
- DO NOT rush architectural decisions
- DO NOT plan in isolation from existing code
- DO NOT forget about error handling and edge cases

## Deliverables

Your plan should include:
- [ ] Clear architecture/design description
- [ ] List of all files to create/modify
- [ ] Implementation order (with rationale)
- [ ] Edge cases and error scenarios identified
- [ ] Testability considerations
- [ ] Alignment with existing patterns confirmed

## Validation Questions

Before moving to `/code`, ask yourself:
- Is this approach aligned with existing architecture?
- Have I considered all edge cases?
- Can this be tested effectively?
- Is the implementation order clear and logical?
- Are there any remaining ambiguities?

## When Ready

Type `/code` to transition to the Implementation stage once your plan is complete and clear.

**Remember**: A good plan makes implementation straightforward. Time spent planning saves multiples of time during coding.
