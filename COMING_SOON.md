## 🎯 Planned Plugins

### agent-loop - Agentic Software Engineering Loop
**4-stage workflow: Explore → Plan → Code → Commit**

Stop jumping straight into code. This plugin will enforce a structured engineering workflow that ensures you understand the problem before solving it.

**Planned Features**:
- **Systematic exploration** of codebases before making changes
- **Structured planning** with task breakdown and dependencies
- **Verification-first coding** with automated test running
- **Conventional commits** with git workflow automation

**Best for**: Complex features, unfamiliar codebases, team collaboration

**Status**: 🚧 In Development

### epti - Evaluate-Plan-Test-Implement
**6-stage TDD workflow with exceptional discipline**

True test-driven development with guardrails that prevent cheating. Write tests first, watch them fail, then implement. No shortcuts.

**Planned Features**:
- **Test generation** from requirements (before any implementation)
- **Failure verification** (ensure tests actually fail first)
- **Protected implementation** (safeguards against overfitting)
- **Overfitting detection** (catch test-specific hacks)
- **Automated test running** with framework detection

**Best for**: Critical systems, API development, refactoring, TDD practitioners

**Status**: 🚧 In Development

### visual-iteration - Screenshot-Driven UI Development
**Iterative refinement workflow for pixel-perfect UIs**

Build UIs through rapid iteration cycles with visual feedback. Capture screenshots, analyze differences, make specific improvements, repeat until perfect.

**Planned Features**:
- **Automated screenshot capture** via MCP browser tools
- **Specific visual feedback** ("32px should be 24px, add 2px border-radius")
- **Before/after comparison** for tracking progress
- **Typical iteration cycles**: 2-3 rounds to pixel perfection

**Best for**: Frontend development, design system implementation, UI polish

**Status**: 🚧 In Development
