# Sprint 1: Foundation & First Plugin

**Sprint Duration**: 2025-10-28 to 2025-11-04 (1 week)
**Generated**: 2025-10-28 06:29:00
**Source Backlog**: BACKLOG-2025-10-28-062900.md
**Source STATUS**: STATUS-2025-10-28-061728.md
**Sprint Goal**: Establish working foundation with all 3 plugins installable and agent-loop plugin minimally functional

---

## Sprint Goal

By end of Sprint 1, the marketplace should be:
1. ✅ Technically valid (all configs parse, all plugins load)
2. ✅ Complete structure (all 3 plugins exist and registered)
3. ✅ Minimally functional (agent-loop provides working workflow)
4. ✅ Demonstrable (can show explore→plan→code→commit cycle)

**Success Criteria**: Can install marketplace, load agent-loop plugin, and execute /explore and /plan commands successfully.

### Day 3-4: Implement agent-loop Agent (P1-1)

#### P1-1: Create agent-loop Main Agent
**Effort**: 4-6 hours
**Owner**: Developer
**Dependencies**: P0-1, P0-3
**Acceptance**:
- [ ] Agent file created: plugins/agent-loop/agents/workflow-agent.md
- [ ] Agent defines 4-stage workflow: Explore → Plan → Code → Commit
- [ ] Agent instructs use of subagents during explore
- [ ] Agent triggers thinking modes during plan
- [ ] Agent prevents premature coding
- [ ] Agent can be invoked and provides guidance

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Create `plugins/agent-loop/agents/workflow-agent.md`
2. Write agent prompt with clear sections:
   - Introduction: Purpose and workflow overview
   - Stage 1 - Explore: Read files, investigate, use subagents
   - Stage 2 - Plan: Think through solution, create plan document
   - Stage 3 - Code: Implement with verification
   - Stage 4 - Commit: Git operations, PR creation
3. Add guardrails: "Do not write code until exploration and planning complete"
4. Include thinking triggers: "think hard about the architecture"
5. Test agent can be loaded by Claude Code

**Content Structure**:
```markdown
# Software Engineering Workflow Agent

You are an agent that guides users through a disciplined software engineering workflow...

## Stage 1: Explore
[Detailed exploration instructions]
- Use subagents to investigate...
- Read relevant files...
- DO NOT write code yet...

## Stage 2: Plan
[Planning instructions with thinking]
- Think hard about...
- Create a plan document...

## Stage 3: Code
[Implementation instructions]
- Implement from your plan...
- Verify reasonableness...

## Stage 4: Commit
[Git operations]
- Commit changes...
- Create PR...
- Update docs...
```

### Day 5: Implement agent-loop Commands (P1-2)

#### P1-2: Create Slash Commands for agent-loop
**Effort**: 3-4 hours
**Owner**: Developer
**Dependencies**: P1-1
**Acceptance**:
- [ ] /explore command created
- [ ] /plan command created
- [ ] /code command created
- [ ] /commit command created
- [ ] Commands registered in plugin.json
- [ ] Each command is focused and actionable

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Create `plugins/agent-loop/commands/explore.md`:
   ```markdown
   You are in the EXPLORATION phase. Your goal is to understand the codebase and problem space.

   - Read relevant files (ask user for pointers or search)
   - Use subagents to investigate specific questions
   - Understand architecture and patterns
   - DO NOT write any code yet

   When done exploring, suggest running /plan to proceed.
   ```

2. Create `plugins/agent-loop/commands/plan.md`:
   ```markdown
   You are in the PLANNING phase. Think hard about the best solution.

   - Review your exploration findings
   - Use "think harder" mode for complex architectural decisions
   - Create a detailed implementation plan
   - Consider edge cases and testing
   - Write plan to a document or GitHub issue

   When plan is approved, suggest running /code to implement.
   ```

3. Create `plugins/agent-loop/commands/code.md`:
   ```markdown
   You are in the IMPLEMENTATION phase. Code according to the plan.

   - Follow the plan created in /plan phase
   - Implement solution incrementally
   - Verify each piece as you go
   - Ask for clarification if plan is unclear

   When implementation complete, suggest running /commit.
   ```

4. Create `plugins/agent-loop/commands/commit.md`:
   ```markdown
   You are in the COMMIT phase. Finalize and commit the work.

   - Review changes with git diff
   - Create clear commit message
   - Update relevant documentation (READMEs, changelogs)
   - Create pull request with description
   - Verify CI passes
   ```

5. Update plugin.json "commands" array with all 4 files

## Risk Management

### Sprint Risks

1. **Risk**: Claude Code plugin loading mechanism unclear
   - **Impact**: High - Could block testing
   - **Mitigation**: Research plugin docs early, ask for help if needed
   - **Contingency**: Validate JSON/structure manually if loading blocked

2. **Risk**: Plugin #3 naming decision delays progress
   - **Impact**: Low - Only affects Day 1-2
   - **Mitigation**: Make decision in first 2 hours
   - **Contingency**: Use "visual-iteration" as default

3. **Risk**: Agent prompt design takes longer than estimated
   - **Impact**: Medium - Could slip to Sprint 2
   - **Mitigation**: Start with simple prompts, iterate later
   - **Contingency**: Reduce agent complexity, move advanced features to Sprint 2

### Blocked Items Watch
- P1-1 depends on P0-1, P0-3 completing successfully
- P1-2 depends on P1-1 completing successfully
- Any config file issues block plugin loading

### Recommendations for Sprint 2
- Start with epti plugin (similar to agent-loop, faster)
- Add skills and hooks for both agent-loop and epti in parallel
- Consider splitting Plugin #3 work into Sprint 3

---

## Notes

- Sprint can be extended if needed (quality over speed)
- If Plugin #3 naming decision is difficult, use "visual-iteration" as default
- Focus on getting agent-loop working before perfecting it
- Simple is better than complete - can iterate in future sprints
- Test frequently - catch issues early
