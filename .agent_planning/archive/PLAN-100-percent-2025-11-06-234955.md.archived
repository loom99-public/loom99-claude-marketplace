# Implementation Plan: Path to 100% Completion

**Generated**: 2025-11-06 23:49:55
**Source STATUS**: STATUS-100-percent-2025-11-06-234533.md
**Specification**: CLAUDE.md (last modified 2025-11-06)
**Plan Scope**: Concrete, actionable work to move from 42% to 100% completion

---

## Executive Summary

### Current State (from STATUS)

**True Completion**: 42%
- Implementation: 90% (24,459 lines across 4 plugins)
- Validation: 0% (manual testing framework ready, ZERO tests executed)
- Documentation: 40% (accurate stats, false "100%" claims)
- Structural Issues: 14 unfixed issues (86% test pass rate)

**Critical Blocker**: NO functional validation exists. Plugins have NEVER been tested in Claude Code.

### Target State (100% Completion)

**Objective Metrics**:
- All 14 structural issues fixed (95%+ test pass rate)
- Manual testing executed with 80%+ workflow success rate
- All plugins documented (including promptctl)
- Documentation claims match reality
- Zero Critical or High severity bugs
- User can install and use all plugins successfully

### Timeline

**Total Effort**: 54-77 hours over 3-4 weeks
- Week 1: Foundation & Critical Fixes (9-12 hours)
- Week 2-3: Bug Fixing & Iteration (30-45 hours)
- Week 4: Documentation & Release Prep (15-20 hours)

**Critical Path**: Execute P0-6 manual testing (blocks all subsequent work)

## Backlog by Priority

### P0 (CRITICAL) - Foundation & Immediate Blockers

These items MUST be completed before claiming any level of production readiness.

## P0-1: Honesty Update - Remove False "100%" Claims

**Status**: Not Started
**Effort**: Small (30 minutes)
**Dependencies**: None
**Spec Reference**: Project Overview, Current Plugins sections • **Status Reference**: STATUS-100-percent-2025-11-06-234533.md §10 "Executive Summary"

### Description

CLAUDE.md currently claims "100% MVP COMPLETE - Production Ready" for all 3 plugins. The STATUS report definitively proves this claim is false - ZERO functional testing has been executed, 14 structural issues remain unfixed, and there is NO EVIDENCE plugins work in Claude Code. This false claim erodes trust and sets incorrect expectations.

Update CLAUDE.md to reflect the honest reality: implementation is largely complete, but validation has not occurred.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Remove "100% MVP COMPLETE - Production Ready" from line 9
- [ ] Replace with "Implementation 90% Complete - Validation In Progress"
- [ ] Add honest status note: "Manual testing framework complete (17 files, 3,236 lines), functional testing not yet executed (0 tests run)"
- [ ] Remove all "100% COMPLETE ✅" markers from plugin sections (lines 18, 26, 34)
- [ ] Replace with "Implementation Complete - Testing Pending"
- [ ] Add "Known Issues" subsection listing the 14 structural issues
- [ ] Update "Testing Status" from "Ready for manual testing" to "Manual testing framework ready, execution pending"
- [ ] Add prominently: "Production readiness: Cannot be claimed without functional validation"
- [ ] Update plugin count from "3 fully functional plugins" to "4 plugins (3 documented + promptctl undocumented)"
- [ ] Commit with message: "docs: correct false 100% completion claims to reflect actual 42% completion"

### Technical Notes

This is the MOST IMPORTANT item. All subsequent work depends on having honest baseline documentation. False claims destroy credibility and mislead users.

**Lines to modify**:
- Line 9: Current State claim
- Lines 18, 26, 34: Plugin completion markers
- Lines 70, 97, 144: "Status: Fully implemented...Production ready"
- Lines 91, 122, 177: "Testing Status: Ready for manual testing"

## P0-2: Fix 14 Structural Issues

**Status**: Not Started
**Effort**: Small (2-3 hours)
**Dependencies**: None (can start immediately)
**Spec Reference**: All plugin sections • **Status Reference**: STATUS-100-percent-2025-11-06-234533.md §3 "Plugin-by-Plugin Status Analysis"

### Description

Automated structural tests discovered 14 genuine issues across all plugins. These issues will cause confusion, errors, or broken functionality. They represent REAL BUGS that must be fixed before claiming production readiness.

Fix all issues to achieve 95%+ structural test pass rate (currently 86%).

### Acceptance Criteria

#### agent-loop (1 issue - 15 min)
- [ ] Fix broken hooks reference in plugin.json
  - Current: `./hooks/hooks.json` (file does NOT exist)
  - Options: (1) Create missing hooks/hooks.json file, (2) Remove hooks reference, (3) Fix path

#### epti (6 issues - 1 hour)
- [ ] Fix 4 broken command references in agents/tdd-agent.md
  - Remove or replace references to: `/pending`, `/ignore`, `/names`, `/test`
  - These commands do NOT exist (only 6 actual commands: write-tests, verify-fail, commit-tests, implement, iterate, commit-code)
  - Verify: Run cross-reference validation tests
- [ ] Remove 2 TODO comments from production code
  - Search for "TODO" in epti plugin files
  - Either implement the TODO or remove if not needed
  - Verify: Run TODO detection tests

#### visual-iteration (7 issues - 1.5 hours)
- [ ] Fix 11 broken command references in agents/visual-iteration-agent.md
  - Remove or replace references to: `/styles`, `/to`, `/login`, `/mockup`, `/path`, `/manual`, `/fonts`, `/password`, `/components`, `/technology`, `/unavailable`
  - Actual commands are: screenshot, feedback, refine, iterate-loop, commit-visual, compare
  - Verify: Run cross-reference validation tests
- [ ] Fix MCP configuration missing required fields in .mcp.json
  - Review .mcp.json schema requirements
  - Add missing fields for browser-tools MCP server
  - Verify: Run MCP config validation tests
- [ ] Remove 2 XXX comments from production code
  - Search for "XXX" in visual-iteration plugin files
  - Either address the concern or remove if not needed
  - Verify: Run XXX detection tests

#### Final Verification
- [ ] Run full structural test suite: `pytest tests/structural/ -v`
- [ ] Confirm pass rate >= 95% (at least 69 of 73 tests passing)
- [ ] Document remaining failures (if any) with justification
- [ ] Commit fixes with message: "fix: resolve 14 structural issues across all plugins"

### Technical Notes

**Testing command**:
```bash
cd /Users/bmf/Library/Mobile\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/_mine/icode/loom99-claude-marketplace
pytest tests/structural/ -v --tb=short
```

**Priority order**: Fix cross-references first (highest user impact), then config issues, then code comments.

**Expected outcome**: Structural integrity increases from 70-85% to 95%+, eliminating obvious bugs before manual testing.

---

## P0-3: Document promptctl Plugin

**Status**: Not Started
**Effort**: Small (1-2 hours)
**Dependencies**: None
**Spec Reference**: N/A (plugin not in spec) • **Status Reference**: STATUS-100-percent-2025-11-06-234533.md §3.4 "Plugin 4: promptctl (UNDOCUMENTED)"

### Description

A fourth plugin (promptctl) exists in the marketplace but is completely undocumented in CLAUDE.md. Users have NO IDEA it exists. The STATUS report shows it has comprehensive files (hooks/hooks.json, bin/dispatch.py, README.md) but zero visibility.

Determine if promptctl is production-ready or experimental, then document appropriately.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Read promptctl README.md to understand purpose and status
- [ ] Read promptctl hooks/hooks.json to understand functionality
- [ ] Read promptctl bin/dispatch.py to understand implementation
- [ ] Decide: Is promptctl production or experimental?
- [ ] If production: Add full section to CLAUDE.md (following agent-loop/epti/visual-iteration format)
  - Purpose statement
  - Implementation details (files, lines)
  - Architecture explanation
  - Testing status
- [ ] If experimental: Add "Experimental Plugins" section noting promptctl exists but is not production-ready
- [ ] Update plugin count in CLAUDE.md from "3 plugins" to "4 plugins"
- [ ] Update total line count to include promptctl (if production)
- [ ] If production: Add promptctl to manual testing scenarios
- [ ] If experimental: Document why it's experimental and what's needed for production
- [ ] Commit with message: "docs: add promptctl plugin documentation"

### Technical Notes

**Files to review**:
- `/Users/bmf/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/_mine/icode/loom99-claude-marketplace/plugins/promptctl/README.md`
- `/Users/bmf/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/_mine/icode/loom99-claude-marketplace/plugins/promptctl/hooks/hooks.json`
- `/Users/bmf/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/_mine/icode/loom99-claude-marketplace/plugins/promptctl/bin/dispatch.py`

promptctl uses a different architecture (hooks-based automation) vs. agent-loop/epti/visual-iteration (agents + commands + skills). Document this architectural difference clearly.

## P0-4: Execute P0-6 Manual Testing - agent-loop

**Status**: Not Started
**Effort**: Medium (2-3 hours)
**Dependencies**: P0-2 (fix structural issues first to avoid wasting testing time)
**Spec Reference**: agent-loop implementation sections • **Status Reference**: STATUS-100-percent-2025-11-06-234533.md §4 "Testing Status: The Critical Gap"

### Description

**THIS IS THE CRITICAL BLOCKER**. agent-loop has NEVER been tested in Claude Code. NO EVIDENCE exists that it works. Without execution, all "production ready" claims are baseless speculation.

---

## P0-7: Consolidate Manual Testing Results

**Status**: Not Started
**Effort**: Small (1 hour)
**Dependencies**: P0-4, P0-5, P0-6 (all manual testing complete)
**Spec Reference**: N/A • **Status Reference**: STATUS-100-percent-2025-11-06-234533.md §4 "Testing Status: The Critical Gap"

### Description

After executing manual testing for all 3 main plugins, consolidate results into comprehensive report. This provides the first real evidence of functionality and creates actionable bug backlog.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Update TESTING_RESULTS.md with aggregate statistics
  - Total tests executed (across all plugins)
  - Tests passed (count and %)
  - Tests failed (count and %)
  - Overall pass rate
- [ ] Categorize all discovered issues by severity
  - Critical: Prevents core functionality (installation fails, commands don't execute, workflows can't complete)
  - High: Major usability problems (confusing guidance, broken agent references, significant bugs)
  - Medium: Quality issues (poor documentation, TODO comments, minor bugs)
  - Low: Nice-to-have improvements (UI polish, error messages)
- [ ] Create issue summary table
  - Plugin | Critical | High | Medium | Low | Total
- [ ] File GitHub issues for all Critical and High severity bugs
  - Use consistent issue template
  - Tag with plugin name
  - Link to TESTING_RESULTS.md sections
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with honest testing status
  - "Manual testing executed: [date]"
  - "Pass rate: X%"
  - "Known Critical issues: N"
  - "Known High issues: N"
- [ ] Determine production readiness per plugin
  - Metrics: pass rate >= 70%, zero Critical bugs, <= 2 High bugs
  - Document verdict: Production Ready / Not Ready / Needs Work
- [ ] Commit with message: "test: manual testing results for agent-loop, epti, visual-iteration"

### Technical Notes

**Evidence Required**: This work item provides the FIRST REAL EVIDENCE that plugins work (or don't). It's the foundation for all claims about production readiness.

**Expected Discovery**: Based on STATUS structural analysis, expect 10-20 issues total across all plugins.

**Decision Point**: If overall pass rate < 60%, DO NOT proceed with production release. Focus entirely on bug fixing until rate >= 80%.

---

### P1 (HIGH) - Bug Fixing & Iteration (Week 2-3)

These items are required to achieve production quality (80%+ success rate).

---

## P1-1: Analyze Manual Testing Results & Prioritize Fixes

**Status**: Not Started
**Effort**: Small (2-4 hours)
**Dependencies**: P0-7 (manual testing results consolidated)
**Spec Reference**: N/A • **Status Reference**: STATUS-100-percent-2025-11-06-234533.md §5 "Phase 2: Iterate on Testing Results"

### Description

Review all issues discovered during manual testing. Understand failure patterns, root causes, and impact. Create prioritized bug fix backlog with effort estimates.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Review all filed GitHub issues (Critical and High)
- [ ] Review all documented Medium/Low issues in TESTING_RESULTS.md
- [ ] Identify patterns
  - Are failures clustered in one plugin?
  - Are cross-reference issues most common?
  - Are there systemic problems (e.g., agent guidance quality)?
- [ ] Group issues by plugin and type
  - agent-loop: [list issues]
  - epti: [list issues]
  - visual-iteration: [list issues]
  - Cross-plugin: [list issues]
- [ ] Estimate effort for each Critical/High bug
  - Small: < 1 hour
  - Medium: 1-3 hours
  - Large: 3-8 hours
  - XL: > 8 hours
- [ ] Calculate total fix effort
- [ ] Create prioritized fix order
  1. Critical bugs (by effort, easiest first)
  2. High bugs blocking workflows
  3. High bugs affecting usability
  4. Medium bugs if time permits
- [ ] Document fix plan in new SPRINT file
- [ ] Commit plan with message: "plan: bug fix prioritization based on manual testing"

### Technical Notes

**Decision Criteria**:
- If total Critical bug count > 10: Focus exclusively on Critical, delay release
- If total Critical + High count > 20: Re-evaluate scope, consider dropping a plugin
- If visual-iteration has > 50% of issues: Consider marking as "beta" instead of production

**Output**: SPRINT-bugfix-[timestamp].md with ordered, estimated work items

---

## P1-2: Fix All Critical Bugs

**Status**: Not Started
**Effort**: Large (1-2 weeks, depending on bug count)
**Dependencies**: P1-1 (prioritization complete)
**Spec Reference**: All plugin sections • **Status Reference**: STATUS-100-percent-2025-11-06-234533.md §5 "ITERATE-1: Fix Critical Bugs from P0-6"

### Description

Fix every Critical severity bug discovered in manual testing. Critical bugs prevent core functionality - plugins cannot be production-ready until these are resolved.

### Acceptance Criteria

**Per Bug**:
- [ ] Reproduce bug in test environment
- [ ] Identify root cause
- [ ] Implement fix
- [ ] Verify fix resolves bug (retest specific scenario)
- [ ] Run structural tests to ensure no regressions
- [ ] Update documentation if behavior changed
- [ ] Commit fix with message: "fix: [brief description] (fixes #N)"

**Aggregate**:
- [ ] All Critical bugs resolved (0 remaining)
- [ ] All fixes tested individually
- [ ] Regression suite passed (structural tests 95%+)
- [ ] TESTING_RESULTS.md updated with retest results
- [ ] GitHub issues closed with "Fixed in [commit]" comments

### Technical Notes

**Iteration Approach**: Fix 2-3 bugs, retest, commit. Don't fix all bugs before testing - you'll introduce regressions.

**Testing Protocol**: After each fix, rerun the specific manual test scenario that discovered the bug. Then run full structural suite.

**Documentation**: If a fix changes expected behavior, update CLAUDE.md, README.md, or command documentation.

**Estimated Effort**: Assuming 5-10 Critical bugs discovered, expect 1-2 weeks of focused work (40-80 hours).

---

## P1-3: Fix All High Severity Bugs

**Status**: Not Started
**Effort**: Medium (3-5 days)
**Dependencies**: P1-2 (Critical bugs fixed first)
**Spec Reference**: All plugin sections • **Status Reference**: STATUS-100-percent-2025-11-06-234533.md §5 "ITERATE-2: Fix High Severity Bugs"

### Description

Fix all High severity bugs discovered in manual testing. High bugs cause major usability problems - users can complete workflows but with significant frustration.

### Acceptance Criteria

**Per Bug**:
- [ ] Reproduce bug in test environment
- [ ] Decide: Fix or document workaround
- [ ] If fixing: implement, test, commit (same protocol as P1-2)
- [ ] If workaround: document in CLAUDE.md "Known Issues" section
- [ ] Update TESTING_RESULTS.md with resolution

**Aggregate**:
- [ ] All High bugs resolved OR documented with workarounds
- [ ] Fixes tested individually and in aggregate
- [ ] Regression suite passed
- [ ] Workarounds clearly documented for users
- [ ] GitHub issues closed or marked "wontfix" with rationale

### Technical Notes

**Fix vs. Workaround Decision**:
- Fix if: Root cause clear, fix is < 4 hours, no workaround exists
- Workaround if: Fix is complex (> 8 hours), acceptable alternative exists, affects edge case

**Documentation**: High severity issues with workarounds MUST be documented prominently in CLAUDE.md so users know what to expect.

**Estimated Effort**: Assuming 5-15 High bugs discovered, expect 3-5 days (24-40 hours).

---

## P1-4: Re-execute Full Manual Test Suite

**Status**: Not Started
**Effort**: Medium (3-5 hours)
**Dependencies**: P1-2, P1-3 (all Critical and High bugs fixed)
**Spec Reference**: All plugin sections • **Status Reference**: STATUS-100-percent-2025-11-06-234533.md §5 "ITERATE-2: Fix High Severity Bugs"

### Description

After fixing all Critical and High bugs, re-run complete manual test suite for all plugins. Validate fixes work and no regressions introduced. Establish new pass rate baseline.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Re-execute P0-4 test scenarios for agent-loop
- [ ] Re-execute P0-5 test scenarios for epti
- [ ] Re-execute P0-6 test scenarios for visual-iteration
- [ ] Document results in TESTING_RESULTS.md (append "Retest - [date]" section)
- [ ] Calculate new pass rates per plugin
- [ ] Calculate overall pass rate
- [ ] Verify Critical bugs resolved (0 Critical bugs in retest)
- [ ] Verify High bugs resolved or have documented workarounds
- [ ] Compare pass rates: initial vs. retest
  - Expect improvement from ~50-60% to 80%+
- [ ] If pass rate < 80%, identify remaining blockers and iterate
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with retest results
- [ ] Commit with message: "test: retest after bug fixes, pass rate now X%"

### Technical Notes

**Success Criteria**: Overall pass rate >= 80%, per-plugin pass rate >= 70%

**If Success Criteria Not Met**: Create new bug fix sprint (P1-5) with remaining issues. Do NOT proceed to P2 until 80% threshold met.

**Regression Detection**: If any previously passing test now fails, that's a regression. File as Critical and fix immediately.

---

## P1-5: Update CLAUDE.md with Accurate Status

**Status**: Not Started
**Effort**: Small (30 minutes)
**Dependencies**: P1-4 (retesting complete)
**Spec Reference**: All sections • **Status Reference**: STATUS-100-percent-2025-11-06-234533.md §6 "ITERATE-3: Update CLAUDE.md with Real Status"

### Critical Path

The absolute minimum sequence to claim "100% complete":

1. **P0-1**: Remove false "100%" claims (30 min) - IMMEDIATE
2. **P0-2**: Fix 14 structural issues (2-3 hours) - CRITICAL
3. **P0-4, P0-5, P0-6**: Execute manual testing (6-9 hours) - BLOCKS EVERYTHING
4. **P0-7**: Consolidate results (1 hour)
5. **P1-2**: Fix Critical bugs found (1-2 weeks)
6. **P1-4**: Retest (3-5 hours)
7. **P1-5**: Update documentation accurately (30 min)
8. **P2-4**: Final validation (2-3 days)

Everything else is supporting work that improves quality but isn't strictly required for "100% complete" claim.

## Risk Assessment

### HIGH RISK - Items that could derail 100% completion

**Risk 1: Manual Testing Discovers Critical Architectural Flaws**
- Probability: Medium (30%)
- Impact: Severe (requires re-design, delays 2-4 weeks)
- Mitigation: Fix structural issues (P0-2) first, test incrementally
- Contingency: If architectural flaw found, scope down to 2 plugins, mark third as experimental

**Risk 2: MCP Integration Fundamentally Broken (visual-iteration)**
- Probability: High (50%)
- Impact: High (visual-iteration not production-ready)
- Mitigation: Test MCP early (P0-6), have manual screenshot fallback documented
- Contingency: Mark visual-iteration as "beta - MCP issues", focus on agent-loop and epti

**Risk 3: Bug Count Exceeds Capacity (> 30 Critical+High bugs)**
- Probability: Medium (40%)
- Impact: High (delays 100% by 2-4 weeks)
- Mitigation: Fix bugs incrementally, retest frequently, prioritize ruthlessly
- Contingency: Reduce scope - focus on 1-2 plugins only, defer others

**Risk 4: Fresh Installation Fails (P2-4)**
- Probability: Low (20%)
- Impact: High (distribution blocked)
- Mitigation: Test installation early and frequently
- Contingency: Debug installation, update documentation, consider alternative distribution

---

### MEDIUM RISK - Items that could delay but not derail

**Risk 5: Documentation Takes Longer Than Estimated**
- Probability: Medium (40%)
- Impact: Medium (delays release by 3-5 days)
- Mitigation: Use visual-iteration README as template, reuse testing examples
- Contingency: Ship with minimal docs, iterate post-release

**Risk 6: Retest Reveals New Bugs (P1-4)**
- Probability: High (60%)
- Impact: Medium (additional fix cycle needed)
- Mitigation: Test incrementally, run regression suite after each fix
- Contingency: Create Sprint 2.5 for additional bug fixes

**Risk 7: Performance Issues Require Optimization**
- Probability: Low (20%)
- Impact: Low (P3-2 becomes required instead of optional)
- Mitigation: Measure performance during P2-4
- Contingency: Optimize critical path only, document known slow operations

---

### LOW RISK - Minor delays

**Risk 8: Formatting/Polish Takes Extra Time**
- Probability: High (70%)
- Impact: Low (1-2 days delay)
- Mitigation: Accept "good enough" polish, iterate post-release
- Contingency: Ship with known minor polish issues

---

- **Impact**: CRITICAL - Blocks entire project
- **Resolution**: Human must execute P0-4, P0-5, P0-6
- **Timeline**: Can begin immediately after P0-2 (fix structural issues)
- **Owner**: Brandon Fryslie (or designated tester)

**BLOCKER #2**: MCP integration unknown (visual-iteration)
- **Impact**: HIGH - May block visual-iteration production readiness
- **Resolution**: Test browser-tools MCP server during P0-6
- **Timeline**: Week 1
- **Owner**: Brandon Fryslie (or designated tester)

**BLOCKER #3**: promptctl purpose unclear
- **Impact**: MEDIUM - Need decision on production vs. experimental
- **Resolution**: Review promptctl implementation, make decision (P0-3)
- **Timeline**: Day 1-2
- **Owner**: Brandon Fryslie (original implementer)

---

### Questions Requiring Decisions

**QUESTION #1**: What is the distribution strategy?
- Personal use only?
- Public marketplace?
- Anthropic submission?
- Decision impacts: P3-3 (contribution guidelines), licensing, support expectations

**QUESTION #2**: What is acceptable pass rate for production?
- Recommendation: 80% overall, 70% per-plugin
- Stricter: 90% overall, 80% per-plugin
- More lenient: 70% overall, 60% per-plugin
- Decision impacts: Sprint 2-3 effort and timeline

**QUESTION #3**: Should visual-iteration be marked beta if MCP broken?
- Option A: Mark as beta, ship with manual screenshot workflow documented
- Option B: Delay release until MCP working
- Option C: Remove from initial release, focus on agent-loop and epti
- Decision impacts: Scope and timeline

**QUESTION #4**: Is perfectionism or shipping more important?
- Option A: Ship with known issues documented (faster, iterative)
- Option B: Fix everything before release (slower, higher quality)
- Recommendation: Option A (document known issues, iterate)
- Decision impacts: Timeline and scope

**Current Completion: 42%**
- Implementation: 90% (files exist, 14 bugs)
- Validation: 0% (no testing executed)
- Documentation: 40% (stats accurate, claims false)

**Critical Finding**: "ZERO testing has been performed in Claude Code (0 functional validation)"

**Structural Issues (14 total)**:
1. agent-loop: Missing hooks/hooks.json file (1 issue)
2. epti: 4 broken command references, 2 TODO comments (6 issues)
3. visual-iteration: 11 broken command references, MCP config incomplete, 2 XXX comments (14 total, but wait - count is 7 for visual-iteration)

Wait, let me recalculate:
- agent-loop: 1 (broken hooks) + TODOs
- epti: 4 (cross-refs) + 2 (TODOs) = 6
- visual-iteration: 11 (cross-refs) + 1 (MCP) + 2 (XXX) = 14

That's 21 total, not 14. Let me check STATUS again... STATUS says "10 test failures" representing "14 structural issues". So the test failure count doesn't map 1:1 to issue count.

**Clarification**: Trust STATUS's "14 structural issues" count. The breakdown is approximate - fix ALL issues found by structural tests.

**False Claims in CLAUDE.md**:
- "100% MVP COMPLETE - Production Ready" (line 9)
- "100% COMPLETE ✅" for all 3 plugins
- "Production ready" status
- "Ready for manual testing and user deployment"

**Reality**:
- Files exist: TRUE
- Functionality validated: FALSE
- Production ready: FALSE (no evidence)
- Testing executed: FALSE

**Timeline to 100%**: 3-4 weeks (54-77 hours)

## File Management and Retention

Per project-evaluator's retention policy, maintain EXACTLY 4 files per prefix (PLAN, SPRINT, STATUS).

**Current Files**:
- PLAN: 2 files (PLAN-testing-framework-next-steps, PLAN-verbosity-reduction)
- SPRINT: 2 files (SPRINT-03, SPRINT-03-KICKOFF)
- BACKLOG: 1 file
- STATUS: 3 files

**After Writing This Plan**:
- PLAN: 3 files (existing 2 + this new one = PLAN-100-percent-2025-11-06-234955.md)
- Retention: No action needed (< 4 files)

**Archive Policy**:
- Only archive when > 4 files exist for a prefix
- Archive to `.agent_planning/archive/` with `.archived` suffix
- Prioritize archiving oldest or superseded files

## Provenance

**Source STATUS File**: STATUS-100-percent-2025-11-06-234533.md
- Generated: 2025-11-06 23:45:33
- Auditor: Ruthless Project Auditor (Zero-Optimism Policy)
- Context: Testing framework 73% complete, 251/291 tests passing
- True Completion: 42%

**Specification**: CLAUDE.md
- Last Modified: 2025-11-06
- Contains false "100% complete" claims (to be corrected in P0-1)

**Generation Time**: 2025-11-06 23:49:55

**Planning Horizon**: 3-4 weeks

**Critical Path**: Execute manual testing (P0-4 through P0-6) - BLOCKS EVERYTHING

---

**END OF PLAN**

This plan is concrete, actionable, and grounded in STATUS evidence. Every work item has specific acceptance criteria, effort estimates, and dependencies. The critical path is clear: fix structural issues, execute manual testing, fix bugs, validate, document. Timeline is realistic: 3-4 weeks to legitimate 100%.
