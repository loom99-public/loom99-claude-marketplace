   ```markdown
   # Test-Driven Development Agent

   You are an agent that guides test-driven development with strict discipline.

   ## Core Principles
   - Tests ALWAYS written before implementation
   - Tests MUST fail before implementation begins
   - Tests and implementation committed separately
   - Implementation NEVER modifies tests
   - Iteration continues until all tests pass

   ## Stage 1: Write Tests
   [Detailed test writing instructions]
   - Generate tests from requirements
   - DO NOT write any implementation code
   - DO NOT create mock implementations
   - Ensure tests are comprehensive
   - Use subagents to verify test completeness

   ## Stage 2: Verify Tests Fail
   [Test execution instructions]
   - Run test suite
   - Verify tests fail (proving they test the right thing)
   - If tests pass, they're testing nothing - rewrite

   ## Stage 3: Commit Tests
   [Git operations for tests only]
   - Commit tests separately
   - Clear commit message: "Add tests for [feature]"

   ## Stage 4: Implement
   [Implementation instructions]
   - Write code to pass tests
   - DO NOT modify tests
   - Focus on simplest implementation that passes

   ## Stage 5: Iterate
   [Iteration loop]
   - Run tests
   - If failures, adjust implementation (NOT tests)
   - Use subagents to verify no overfitting
   - Repeat until all pass

   ## Stage 6: Commit Implementation
   [Git operations for implementation]
   - Commit implementation separately
   - Update documentation if needed
   ```

3. Add guardrails to prevent common mistakes
4. Include test framework detection logic
5. Emphasize no test modification during implementation

**Deliverable**: tdd-agent.md created, comprehensive and clear

   - Create commit message: "Add tests for [feature]"
   - Commit test files only

   When committed, suggest running /implement.
   ```

4. Create `plugins/epti/commands/implement.md`:

   - Implement simplest solution that passes tests
   - DO NOT modify tests
   - Focus on clarity and correctness

   When implementation ready, suggest running /iterate.
   ```

5. Create `plugins/epti/commands/iterate.md`:
   ```markdown
   You are in ITERATION phase. Run tests and refine.

   - Run test suite
   - If failures, adjust IMPLEMENTATION (not tests)
   - Use subagents to verify not overfitting to tests
   - Repeat until all tests pass
   - Consider edge cases and error handling

   When all tests pass, suggest running /commit-code.
   ```

## Risk Management

### Sprint Risks

1. **Risk**: Test framework detection complexity
   - **Impact**: Medium - Could delay epti hooks
   - **Mitigation**: Start with 3 frameworks (pytest, jest, go test), expand later
   - **Contingency**: Manual framework specification as fallback

2. **Risk**: Overfitting detection proves difficult
   - **Impact**: Medium - May not be effective
   - **Mitigation**: Start with subagent verification, can enhance in P3
   - **Contingency**: Document as "use sparingly" rather than automatic

3. **Risk**: Hook execution environment limitations
   - **Impact**: Low - Hooks may not work as expected
   - **Mitigation**: Test early in sprint, adapt if needed
   - **Contingency**: Document hooks as optional, focus on commands

4. **Risk**: Documentation takes longer than estimated
   - **Impact**: Low - Can extend sprint slightly
   - **Mitigation**: Use templates, focus on essentials first
   - **Contingency**: Complete critical docs (root README), defer nice-to-haves

### Blocked Items Watch
- P1-4 depends on P1-3 (git operations skill)
- P1-6 depends on P1-5 (agent defines workflow)
- P1-8 depends on P1-7 (test execution skill)
- P2-2, P2-3 depend on respective plugin completion
- P2-1 depends on P2-2, P2-3 (plugin READMEs for linking)

- Sprint 1 lessons: focus, test, document, verify
- Use templates to speed documentation
- Leverage agent-loop implementation patterns for epti (similar structure)
- Consider pairing on complex items (agent implementations)
- Celebrate milestone: first 2 plugins complete is significant!
